Given an essay, this project uses machine learning and token classification to separate the essay into distinct argumentative elements (eg. Claim, Evidence, Counterclaim, etc.)

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/data. Save the dataset in a directory called "dataset". The code accesses the data in that directory.

The trained model can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/reymaster/token-classification-trained-longformer?select=token_classification_model
